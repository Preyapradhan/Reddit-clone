## Project Overview

This project replicates a Reddit-like page, focusing on creating a pixel-perfect static design with dynamic integration for the "Popular" section using the Reddit Open API. 

While most sections are static, the **Popular** section fetches real-time data for posts from Reddit. You can sort posts dynamically based on options like **hot**, **new**, or **controversial**.

### Design Goals

- Build a static page that matches the provided design specifications as closely as possible.
- Ensure a dynamic and functional **Popular** section powered by the Reddit API.
- Optionally implement a **Search** feature and pagination for enhanced functionality.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Popular Section**:
  - Fetches posts using the Reddit API: `https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/{sort}/.json?limit={limit}`.
  - Sort options: **hot**, **new**, **controversial**, etc.
  - Customizable subreddit and post limit.

- **Optional Search Functionality**:
  - Implements search using: `https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={query}`.

- **Static Sections**:
  - Favorites, Reddit Feeds, and other non-dynamic sections are hardcoded.

- **Pixel-Perfect Design**:
  - Matches the provided design specifications as closely as possible.

## API Integration

- **Fetch Posts**:
  - Use the API: `https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/{sort}/.json?limit={limit}`.
  - Replace `{subreddit}` with the desired subreddit name (e.g., `technology`).
  - Replace `{sort}` with sorting options like **hot**, **new**, or **controversial**.
  - Replace `{limit}` with the number of posts to fetch.

- **Search Posts**:
  - Use the API: `https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={query}`.
  - Replace `{query}` with the desired search term.

- **Pagination**:
  - Use `after` and `before` parameters to navigate through results.

---

## Additional Considerations

- Be mindful of [Reddit's API rate limits](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/).
- All links and buttons in the design are static unless specifically mentioned.
